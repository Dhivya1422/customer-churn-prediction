Customer Churn Prediction 📊
Project Overview

Customer churn happens when users stop using a service.
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, so businesses can take action early.
OBJECTIVE
Predict customer churn

Handle imbalanced data using SMOTE

Train and compare ML models

Derive meaningful business insights

DATASET
Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Source: Kaggle

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

APPROACH
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Encoding and feature scaling

Handling class imbalance using SMOTE

Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

RESULTS
Random Forest achieved ~78% accuracy

Churn prediction improved after balancing the data

KEY INSIGHTS
month-to-month customers churn more

Higher monthly charges increase churn risk

Long-term contracts reduce churn significantly

CONCLUSION

This project shows how machine learning can be used to identify customers at risk of churning and help businesses improve retention strategies.
